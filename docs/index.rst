Hugs all around!
================

This reinvention of `grouphugs`_ in python is still in its early stages. Here's what we have so far:

* The bot extends `lurklib`_ and can connect and join specified server/channels.
* The config (server, channels, modules) is set in ``config.json``.
* :doc:`Modules </modules>` can be created with a simple interface to bot events, etc.
