Future plans, aka TODO
======================

Most of this is stuff that's already implemented in the Java version of grouphugs.

* Database access
* github post-recieve hook
* Help messages
* Split messages longer than the IRC message limit (lurklib raises exception)
* Preventing channel spam, separate spam trigger
* Autoreconnect on server disconnect (might already exist in lurklib?)
* Nickpoller (might already exist in lurklib?)
